Since 2023, I have been dedicated to low-light image enhancement, aiming to improve the performance of advanced visual algorithms in dark environments through this work. To date, I have yet to encounter an algorithm that can be effectively implemented in engineering applications and operate in real-time, which has been a source of great frustration for me. My own early work was not outstanding, so I am determined to launch the project<strong> "Putting an End to Darkness"</strong> and strive to contribute to this niche research area.
